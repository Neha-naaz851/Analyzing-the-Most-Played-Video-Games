Project Title: Playtime Patterns — Analyzing the Most Played Video Games
This project focuses on performing an end-to-end data analysis of a dataset containing information about the 1,000 most played video games worldwide. The objective was to uncover key trends related to game popularity, player behavior, genre distribution, and platform usage.

The analysis began with data cleaning, where missing values, duplicates, and data types were checked to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python and Pandas to understand the central tendencies and distributions of variables such as total players, total installs, and average playtime per week. Categorical variables like game genre, platform, and online multiplayer support were analyzed to identify dominant patterns.

Key findings include the high popularity of sandbox and first-person shooter games, a growing number of releases on multi-platform and PC systems, and an average weekly playtime of around 8.5 hours. Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots were used to present insights clearly and effectively.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply core data analysis skills—from data wrangling to visualization—to uncover meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making in the gaming industry.
